/**
 * A simple log-structured library.
 * 
 * Journal is essentially an append-only data file (*.dat) with an index file (*.idx) used to speed up lookups.
 * No complex data structures, no sofisticated algorithms, only basic file access.
 * We rely on the filesystem cache (managed by the operating system) to ensure read performance.
 * 
 * Main features:
 *   - Variable length record type
 *   - Records uniquely identified by a sequential number (seqnum)
 *   - Records are indexed by timestamp (monotonic non-decreasing field)
 *   - There are no other indexes other than seqnum and timestamp
 *   - Records can be appended, read, and searched
 *   - Records cannot be updated or deleted
 *   - Allows reverting the last entries (rollback)
 *   - Allows removing obsolete entries (purge)
 *   - Supports read-write concurrency (multi-thread)
 *   - Automatic data recovery in case of catastrofic events
 *   - Minimal memory footprint
 *   - No dependencies
 * 
 * dat file format
 * ---------------
 * 
 * Contains the journal entries.
 * 
 * @see struct ldb_header_dat_t
 * @see struct ldb_record_dat_t
 * 
 *     header        record1          data1          record2       data2
 * ┌──────┴──────┐┌─────┴─────┐┌────────┴────────┐┌─────┴─────┐┌─────┴─────┐...
 *   magic number   seqnum1        raw bytes 1      seqnum2     raw bytes 2
 *   format         timestamp1                      timestamp2
 *   etc            checksum1                       checksum2
 *                  length1                         length2
 * 
 * idx file format
 * ---------------
 * 
 * Used to search for journal entries.
 * If idx file does not exist, it is rebuilt from the data.
 * 
 * @see struct ldb_header_idx_t
 * @see struct ldb_record_idx_t
 * 
 *      header      record1       record2
 * ┌──────┴──────┐┌─────┴─────┐┌─────┴─────┐...
 *   magic number   seqnum1      seqnum2
 *   format         timestamp1   timestamp2
 *   etc            pos1         pos2
 * 
 * We can access directly any record by seqnum because:
 *  - we know the first seqnum in the file
 *  - we know the last seqnum in the file
 *  - idx header has fixed size
 *  - all idx records have same size
 *
 * We use the binary search method over the index records to search data by timestamp.
 * In all cases, we rely on the system file caches to store data in memory.
 * 
 * Concurrency
 * ---------------
 * 
 * Main goal: append() function not blocked.
 * File write ops are done with [dat|idx]_fp.
 * File read ops are done with [dat|idx]_fd.
 * 
 * We use 2 mutex:
 *   - data mutex: Ensures data integrity ([first|last]_[seqnum|timestamp])
 *                 Reduced scope (variables update)
 *   - file mutex: Ensures no reads are done during destructive writes
 *                 Extended scope (function execution)
 * 
 *                             File     Data
 * Thread        Function      Mutex    Mutex   Notes
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------
 *               ┌ open()         -       -     Initialize mutexes, create FILEs used to write and fds used to read
 *               ├ append()       -       W     dat and idx files flushed at the end. State updated after flush.
 * thread-write: ┼ rollback()     W       W     
 *               ├ purge()        W       W     
 *               └ close()        -       -     Destroy mutexes, close files
 *               ┌ stats()        R       R     
 * thread-read:  ┼ read()         R       R
